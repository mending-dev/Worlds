# Worlds

A lightweight yet powerful plugin for Paper servers (version 1.21+), designed to make world management simple, fast, and flexible. With Worlds, server administrators can create, import, and manage multiple worlds with ease, while controlling world-specific settings like game rules and plugin-provided flags.

Example:

```json
{
  "world": {
    "type": "NORMAL",
    "environment": "NORMAL",
    "difficulty": "PEACEFUL",
    "gameRules": {
      "doDaylightCycle": true,
      "keepInventory": false
    },
    "flags": {
      "pvp": false
    },
